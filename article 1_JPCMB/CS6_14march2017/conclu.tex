\section{Conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this paper, we show that compact approximations in the
on the Cubed Sphere lead to accurate numerical simulations
for hyperbolic problems on the sphere.
The present approach makes use 
of the standard finite difference design.
Since the scheme is centered, some numerical viscosity
needs to be added for time dependent solutions.
In our case, a high order filter is added.
Fourth order accuracy was numerically observed.
The quality of the numerical results can be compared
to the best conservative schemes on irregular grids, such as Discontinuous Galerkin schemes.

Current research involves mathematical analysis
of the scheme, in particular conservation properties.
The same logic can be applied to any form
of the SW system on the sphere.
