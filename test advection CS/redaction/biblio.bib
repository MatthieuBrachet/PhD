abstract = {The Cube-Sphere grid is a spherical grid made of six quasi-cartesian square-like patches. It is originally introduced in [ref]. We extend to this grid the design of high-order finite-difference compact operator [ref, ref]. The present work is limitated to the design of the fourth-order accurate spherical gradient. The treatment at the interface of the six patches relies on a specific interpolation system which is based on using great circles in an essential way. the main interest of the approach is a fully symmetric treatment of the sphere. We numerically demonstrate the accuracy of the approximate gradient on several test problems, including the cosine-bell test case of Williamson et al. [ref] and a deformational test-case reported in [ref].},

abstract = {A mass-conservative cell-integrated semi-Lagrangian (CISL) scheme is presented and tested for 2D transport
on the sphere. The total mass is conserved exactly and the mass of each individual grid cell is conserved in
general. The scheme is based on a general scheme developed by Machenhauer and Olk that has increased cost
effectiveness without loss of accuracy, compared to the CISL scheme of Rancˇ ic ́. A regular latitude–longitude
grid is used on the sphere and upstream trajectories from the corner points of the regular grid cells (the Eulerian
cells) define the corner points of the departure cells. The sides in these so-called Lagrangian cells are generally
defined as straight lines in a $( \lambda , \mu )$ plane, where $\lambda$ is the longitude and $\mu$ is the sine of the latitude. The mass
distribution within each Eulerian grid cell is defined by quasi-biparabolic functions, which are used to integrate
analytically the mass in each Lagrangian computational cell. The auxiliary computational cells are polygons
with each side parallel to the coordinate axis. Also, the computational cells have the same area as the Lagrangian
cells they approximate. They were introduced in order to simplify the analytical integrals of mass. Near the
poles, the east and west sides of certain Lagrangian cells cannot be approximated by straight lines in the $( \lambda , \mu )$
plane, and are instead represented by straight lines in polar tangent plane coordinates. Each of the latitudinal
belts of Lagrangian cells in the polar caps are split up into several latitudinal belts of subcells, which can be
approximated by computational cells as in the case of cells closer to the equator. One latitudinal belt in each
hemisphere, which encloses the Eulerian pole (singular belt), is treated in a special way. First the total mass in
the singular belt is determined and then it is redistributed among the cells in the belt using weights determined
by a traditional SL scheme at the midpoints of the cells. By this procedure the total mass is still conserved
while the conservation is only approximately maintained for the individual cells in the singular belt. These
special treatments in the polar caps fit well into the general structure of the code and can be implemented with
minor modifications in the code used for the rest of the sphere.
Compared to two other conservative advection schemes implemented on the sphere the CISL scheme used
here was found to be competitive in terms of accuracy for the same resolution. In addition the CISL scheme
has the advantage over these schemes that it is applicable for Courant numbers larger than one. In plane geometry
the scheme of Rancˇic ́ had an overhead factor of 2.5 in CPU time compared to a traditional bicubic semi-
Lagrangian scheme. This factor is reduced to 1.1 for the Machenhauer and Olk scheme on the plane while on
the sphere the factor is found to be 1.28 for the present scheme. This overhead seems to be a reasonable price
to pay for increased accuracy and exact mass conservation.},
